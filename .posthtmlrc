The Lions have been shut out six times, and apart from one five-year winning streak from 1994-98, the Light Blue has never won more than two Homecoming games in a row.

But since Bagnoli joined the Light Blue prior to the start of the 2015 season, he has turned things around. In the past six Homecoming games, the Lions hold a 4-2 record under Bagnoli."

Tied at 28 in overtime, the Quakers scored first with a field goal to regain their lead. But the Lions weren’t intimidated. On their next drive, quarterback Anders Hill, CC ’18, threw a 24-yard game-winning touchdown pass to Josh Wainwright, CC ’20, to secure the win."
